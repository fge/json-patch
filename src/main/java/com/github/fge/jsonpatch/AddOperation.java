/**
 * JSON Patch {@code add} operation
 *
 * <p>For this operation, {@code path} is the JSON Pointer where the value
 * should be added, and {@code value} is the value to add.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that if the target value pointed to by {@code path} already exists,
 * it is replaced. In this case, {@code add} is equivalent to {@code replace}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Note also that a value will be created at the target path <b>if and only
 * if</b> the immediate parent of that value exists (and is of the correct
 * type).</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally, if the last reference token of the JSON Pointer is {@code -} and
 * the immediate parent is an array, the given value is added at the end of the
 * array. For instance, applying:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     { "op": "add", "path": "/-", "value": 3 }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>to:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [ 1, 2 ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>will give:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [ 1, 2, 3 ]
 * </pre>
